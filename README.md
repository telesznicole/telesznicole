## Hi, I’m @telesznicole!
My name is Nicole Telesz, and I'm a full-time student in the Honors Program at the University of Florida pursuing a major in Computer Science through the College of Engineering and a minor in the Digital Arts and Sciences through the College of the Arts.
- I’m interested in game development and computer graphics and visualization.
- I’m currently learning about information and database systems, testing continuous delivery, human-computer interactions, and game content production.
- I know Java, C++ (my favorite), some CSS, some HTML, and some ARMv8.

My current GitHub stats are:
